BOLT.NEW – MASTER PROMPT PLAN (BRS Dashboard, Next.js)

HOW TO USE
- Start with the “Starter Prompt” in a fresh Bolt session to scaffold Next.js App Router layout, tokens, and routes.
- Then run each “Session Prompt” in order, exporting only changed files each time.
- Keep the Style Tokens and Data Schema snippets handy; paste them into later prompts for consistency.

STARTER PROMPT (PASTE INTO BOLT)
You are designing a production‑ready Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind dashboard for an AI “creative QA” tool called Brand Resonance Synth (BRS).
Requirements:
- Tech: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, next-themes for dark mode (`class` strategy).
- IA/Routes: /brs/dashboard, /brs/asset/[id], /brs/submit, /brs/history, /brs/settings, /brs/audits.
- Layout: `app/layout.tsx` (root HTML), `app/brs/layout.tsx` (persistent left sidebar + top nav), page files under `app/brs/*/page.tsx`.
- Components: default to Server Components; mark interactive pieces with `"use client"`.
- Accessibility: landmarks, focus order, keyboard nav, color contrast.
- Components must be responsive (md, lg breakpoints) and accept props (no hard‑coded copy).

Deliver:
1) App Router shell with routes above and stub pages.
2) `components/brs/*`: Sidebar, TopNav, ScoreGauge, AlertList, EditList, EvidenceGrid, DataTable.
3) Apply the following Style Tokens and Data Schema throughout.

Style Tokens:
[STYLE_TOKENS]

Data Schema:
[DATA_SCHEMA]

Place files under `app/brs/...` and `components/brs/...`. Export all created files.

STYLE TOKENS (PASTE AS [STYLE_TOKENS] IN PROMPTS)
- Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24
- Type scale: sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl
- Color roles: surface, subtle, primary, warning, danger, success (light/dark variants via Tailwind classes)
- Shadows: xs, sm, md (subtle)
- Radius: sm (6px), md (10px)
- Motion: fast (100ms), base (160ms)

DATA SCHEMA (PASTE AS [DATA_SCHEMA] IN PROMPTS)
Scorecard JSON shape:
{
  "scores": {"tone":0..1, "ip_risk":0..1, "inclusivity":0..1, "lift":-1..+1, "authenticity":0..1},
  "alerts": [{"type":"authenticity|ip|tone|inclusive","message":"..."}],
  "edits": [{"message":"...","severity":"low|medium|high"}],
  "alternates": [{"type":"text|image","suggestion":"..."}],
  "evidence": [{"thumbnail":"/path.png","label":"logo crop"}],
  "metadata": {"brand":"...","market":"APAC|EMEA|NA","type":"text|image|video"}
}

SESSION PROMPTS (RUN IN ORDER)

Session 1 — Layout + Tokens
Create a Next.js App Router shell:
- Files: `app/layout.tsx` (html/body with ThemeProvider), `app/brs/layout.tsx` (Sidebar + TopNav + main content), and pages: `app/brs/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/brs/asset/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/brs/submit/page.tsx`, `app/brs/history/page.tsx`, `app/brs/settings/page.tsx`, `app/brs/audits/page.tsx`.
- Components in `components/brs/*`: Sidebar, TopNav, ScoreGauge, AlertList, EditList, EvidenceGrid, DataTable.
- Use `next-themes` with `attribute="class"` for dark mode. Apply [STYLE_TOKENS]. Export changed files only.

Session 2 — Dashboard + Gauges
On `app/brs/dashboard/page.tsx`:
- Add five `ScoreGauge` components (props: label, value 0..1, trend, size).
- Add a “Recent Alerts” panel using `AlertList` bound to `/mock/dashboard.json` in `public/`.
- Responsive grid cards; paste [STYLE_TOKENS] + [DATA_SCHEMA]. Export changed files only.

Session 3 — Asset Detail
On `app/brs/asset/[id]/page.tsx`:
- Header: asset preview (image/video/text), score summary (five gauges), metadata chips.
- Tabs: Tone, IP, Inclusive, Lift, Authenticity → each shows `AlertList`, `EditList`, and `EvidenceGrid`.
- Alternates panel with “Apply” (client component). Bind to `/mock/asset-123.json` first. Paste [STYLE_TOKENS] + [DATA_SCHEMA]. Export changed files only.

Session 4 — Submit Flow
On `app/brs/submit/page.tsx` (client component):
- URL/file input, type selector (text/image/video), brand/audience selectors, submit button.
- On submit: show `job_id`, link to History, toasts via a light wrapper.
- Keep server boundaries clean; paste [STYLE_TOKENS] + [DATA_SCHEMA]. Export changed files only.

Session 5 — History & Audits
- `app/brs/history/page.tsx`: `DataTable` with filters (brand/market/type/status), pagination, row link to Asset Detail.
- `app/brs/audits/page.tsx`: table with model version, timestamps, detail drawer with evidence.
- Use `public/mock/*.json`. Export changed files only.

Session 6 — Settings
On `app/brs/settings/page.tsx` (client component):
- Sliders for pillar weights (tone, ip, inclusivity, lift, authenticity) 0..1; show weighted sum.
- JSON editors for allow/deny lists with validation and reset. Load/Save to mock endpoints.
- Export changed files only.

Session 7 — Polish & Motion
- Subtle route transitions and gauge reveal animations (≤100ms).
- A11y: focus order, skip links, ARIA labels on gauges/tabs.
- Empty/loading/error states for all data views.

REGEN/ADJUSTMENT PROMPTS (USE SPARINGLY)
- “Refactor Sidebar to support section headings and collapsible groups; preserve routes and classes.”
- “Normalize card paddings to spacing 16; reduce mobile vertical rhythm by 20%.”
- “Align colors with [STYLE_TOKENS] roles; remove hardcoded hex codes.”

CREDIT‑SAVING TIPS
- Batch instructions; avoid micro‑edits. Lock tokens in Session 1.
- Mock first (public/mock), wire real API after layouts stabilize.
- Export only changed files. Freeze good components; tweak CSS locally.
- Reuse [STYLE_TOKENS] and [DATA_SCHEMA] in every prompt to keep Bolt consistent.

OPTIONAL (NEXT API ROUTE HANDLERS FOR MOCKS)
- Add `app/api/mock/dashboard/route.ts` and `app/api/mock/asset/[id]/route.ts` returning static JSON to simulate backend while designing.
